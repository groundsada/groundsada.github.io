- CI/CD for research software
- Monitoring and observability

## About This Site

This portfolio itself is built with bash-stack, a full-stack web framework written entirely in Bash. The migration from static HTML to a component-based architecture demonstrates the power of unconventional tools when used creatively.

Check back soon for the first posts!
